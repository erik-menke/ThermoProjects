# ThermoProjects
A series of jupyter notebooks and associated data files to help chemistry students learn to use python for solving thermodynamics problems. These notebooks were first used in the Fall, 2025 Introduction to Chemical Thermodynamics course (CHGN 209) at the Colorado School of Mines. Completed notebooks with solutions for instructors can be requested by emailing Prof. Erik Menke at erik.menke@mines.edu.
