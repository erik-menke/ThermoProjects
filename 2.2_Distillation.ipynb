    "Now that you have a working function that implements Raoult's law to find the total vapor pressure for a mixture of liquids, we want to use that function to find the temperature where a mixture has the same vapor pressure as atmospheric pressure (1.0142 bar). In other words, we want to find the boiling temperature for any mixture of liquids. To do this, we are going to use the fsolve() function, similar to what you did in the previous notebook to find the adiabatic flame temperature. However, there is a minor problem in doing this. The fsolve() function finds the value where a given function is equal to zero and we want to know where your Raoult's law function is equal to a given pressure, like 1.0142 bar for example. So, to be able to use fsolve() with your Raoult's law function, you need to write a *new* function that has all the same inputs as your Raoult's law function, plus a pressure, and returns the difference between your Raoult's law function and the input pressure."

    "Now that you can find the boiling temperature for any mole ratio mixture of octane:hexane, let's plot the boiling temperature for all the mole ratios from 0 to 1 of octane in hexane. Because this uses fsolve(), you'll need to use a for loop to get all your temperatures, similar to the for loop I used in the adiabatic flame temperature notebook for the heat required vs temperature graph. In summary, you will want to create an xrange from 0 to 1, which will be the mole fraction of octane, as well as an empty array for your boiling temperature. Then, in a for loop, use the fsolve() function, similar to what you did above, for each mole fraction in the xrange to find the boiling temperature of your mixture, and add that to your boiling temperature array. Finally, you can use the xrange array and boiling temperature array as the x and y values for a plot of mole fraction vs. temperature.

    "Now for the final piece of the octane:hexane liquid-liquid binary phase diagram. In the graph above, you are showing the boiling temperature for every mole fraction mixture of octane in hexane. To this graph we want to add the composition of the vapor at these temperatures, which we can calculate using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation that you defined earlier. To achieve this, use the code from above, but add another empty array for the mole fraction of the vapor. Then, in the for loop, after you find the boiling temperature you can use that  temperature to find the vapor pressure of octane at that temperature, and multiply it by the mole fraction to find the vapor pressure of octane in the mixture. Dalton's law tells us that the mole fraction of octane in the gas phase is just the vapor pressure of octane divided by the total pressure, which is 1.0142 bar. Therefore, you can calculate the mole fraction of octane in the vapor phase and add it to the mole fraction array. Once you've done that for all the mole fractions you can create a plot with two curves, one of your xrange array vs the boiling temperature array, and one of your mole fraction array vs the boiling temperature array. The graph of both will be the binary phase diagram for octane in hexane, which you could then use as a way to predict the distillation of an octane:hexane mixture."
